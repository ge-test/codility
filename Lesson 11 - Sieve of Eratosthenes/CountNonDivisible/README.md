TITLE
=====
Calculate the number of elements of an array that are not divisors of each element.

DESCRIPTION
===========

Task description
You are given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers.

For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are non-divisors.

For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
For the following elements:

* A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
* A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
* A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
* A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
* A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.

REQUIREMENTS
============
Write a function:
```c++
vector<int> solution(vector<int> &A);
```
that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

ASSUMPTIONS
===========
* N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
* each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].

COMPLEXITY
===========

* expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
* expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).


Elements of input arrays can be modified.
